## Project Setup

This repository is split into a web app directory (eg `/webapp`) and two server directories (eg `/webserver` and `/elixir`).

The `/webserver` one includes a functional GraphQL server in NodeJS with MongoDB backing it.

The `/elixir` one includes a functional GraphQL server in Elixir with Postgresql backing it.

Pick one or the other to use.

This project is intentionally not utilizing 3rd party services or create-react-app to give you the opportunity to showcase your talents wherever they are, be it the front end or the back end.

**Node** version **12** is the safest NodeJS release to use.  You can try version 14, but there can be node-gyp/python issues on OSX.<br/>
However, **Node** version **11.15.0** is the version required for yarn install to compile to localhost. Review [nvm docs](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm/blob/master/README.md) for more detail.
